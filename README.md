# Common Kitchen Timer With an LCD-Replacement Board
A replacement PCB board for common 4 digit 7 segment LCD kitchen timers

It uses a cheap TM1621D LCD driver. You can solder either Attiny13A, or ESP12E module. 

The "Print" function can print out supported letters on the screen. However it is not optimised for memory constains for Attiny13A.
